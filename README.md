# lisp-projects
## A repo for my lisp projects
Data is code, code is data, I've been wanting to try lisp for a while now - how many languages have computers built around their execution?
Also it's a good oppourtunity to brush up on my functional programming - while I'm still a little scarred from building a recursive descent parser in haskell without a dedicated lexer, I still enjoy imperative languages
